# StackChips — Claude Context

## Project

StackChips (`stackchips.app`) is a Next.js 16/React 19/strict TypeScript six-max Hold'em app. The server is authoritative. Supabase supplies persistence, Realtime, Auth linkage, and Storage; absent env vars, stores use memory.

## System map

`components -> app/api -> lib/game -> lib/server -> memory | Supabase`

- `app/`: App Router pages/API; `app/page.tsx` mounts `components/poker-app.tsx`.
- `components/`: client state plus lobby, table, profile, store, admin UI.
- `lib/game/`: pure engine/types/evaluator/timing/snapshot redaction.
- `lib/server/`: game/profile/economy/session/admin persistence.
- `lib/supabase/`: shared browser client and SSR helpers.
- `supabase/migrations/`: imperative schema, RLS, RPCs, Realtime.
- `app/styles/`: numbered cascade; `app/globals.css` fixes load order.
- Tests: colocated Vitest units; `tests/e2e/` Playwright.

Realtime carries only versioned invalidations; `components/poker-app.tsx` refetches the filtered snapshot. Browser requests contain intents only.

## Read first

- App/client: `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `components/poker-app.tsx`
- Lobby/table: `components/lobby/lobby.tsx`, `components/table/poker-table.tsx`
- Game routes: `app/api/games/`, especially `[id]/actions/route.ts` and `[id]/advance/route.ts`
- Rules: `lib/game/engine.ts`, `lib/game/types.ts`, `lib/game/evaluator.ts`
- Data: `lib/server/game-store.ts`, `lib/server/profile-store.ts`, `lib/server/supabase-admin.ts`
- Auth: `middleware.ts`, `lib/server/session.ts`, `lib/auth/client.ts`
- Realtime: `lib/game/table-channel.ts`
- DB/env: `supabase/migrations/`, `supabase/config.toml`, `.env.example`
- Product constraints: `docs/game-loop.md`, `docs/launch-checklist.md`, `docs/security-audit.md`

## Rules

- Mutate through server routes + engine; never accept client-owned game truth.
- Keep game reads write-free and mutations version-checked/atomic.
- Never leak service-role secrets or private aggregate state; preserve RLS.
- Append migrations; preserve numbered CSS order.
- `river_*` cookies/module names and Sentry slugs are legacy compatibility IDs; do not casually rename them.
- Test changed rules/layout. Run: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`; use `npm run test:e2e` for flows/UI.
- Preserve unrelated work; `.claude/` may be locally untracked.

## Active milestone

- Track: `ui-redesign-foundation`
- Mobile PWA launch prep is done and live on production (installable shell,
  safe-area fixes, the Adsterra CSP fix) — see the deploy note further down
  for the exact commit/PR this shipped in. Menu music is done as an *engine*
  (still silent — see its own bullet below for what "done" means there). A
  silver/platinum "Prestige" reskin of the app chrome was built and pushed to
  a Preview deployment for review, then explicitly reverted at the user's
  request before it reached `main` — the palette stays green-felt/gold-brass,
  full stop, per `feedback_stackchips_visual_identity` in project memory.
  Don't resurrect that work without a fresh explicit instruction. Active
  slice is now the "away" bot-departure visual (see its own bullet below).
  M16's remaining invite work is still parked, not abandoned — see the M16
  note below.
- The felt's old CSS chip system (`.pot-pile-chip`/`.pot-chip-flight`/
  `.seat-chip-flight`, `components/table/pot-pile.tsx`, `potChipSettleJitter`
  in `lib/game/pot-chips.ts`) is gone, replaced by a real WebGL room:
  `lib/scene/` (pure, deterministic logic — camera/lighting/layer/chip-physics
  constants, seat-ring math, a fit solver, a dirty-flag render scheduler, the
  `webglAvatars` feature flag — 71 Vitest cases, reachable because
  `vitest.config.ts` covers `lib/`) driving `components/table/scene/`
  (the three.js renderer: canvas-drawn chip/carpet/shadow textures, the room
  mesh, a billboarded-sprite avatar layer, a pooled `ChipLayer`, and the
  mounting `TableScene` component). A fixed cockpit `PerspectiveCamera` at
  `(0,12,14)` looks at the table; one warm `SpotLight` over the pot is the
  only real light, its intensity derived from lamp-to-felt distance
  (`spotlightIntensityFor`) rather than stated flat, because three r155+'s
  physically-based lights turn a flat "intensity 5" into a near-black table
  otherwise. Layers A (floor)/B (chairs)/D (rim) always render live, replacing
  the DOM felt art (`.scene-lit` in `app/styles/22-scene.css` zeroes out
  `.poker-felt`/`.poker-rail`'s own backgrounds once the room mounts). Layer C
  (avatar sprites) ships **on by default** (`lib/scene/flags.ts`; verified
  live by `table-scene.spec.ts`), with `?webglAvatars=0` as an explicit
  kill switch that falls back to the flat DOM `.seat-figure` plates — kept
  in the tree for exactly that reason, not deleted. With the sprites
  drawing, the room is the layout authority and projects its own seat ring
  back onto the DOM via an `onSeatProjection` callback (`projectSeatRing`
  in `components/table/scene/room.ts`), because fitting the two independent
  ring shapes to agree by scale/position alone left a ~184px residual at
  the side seats. Chip physics
  (`lib/scene/chip-physics.ts`) is a frame-rate-independent friction-slide
  lerp (`0.075` per 60fps-equivalent frame, converted via
  `lerpFactorForDelta` so a 30fps phone takes the same wall-clock time as
  60fps) with a mid-flight arc, matching the same 3-chip/20ms bet stagger and
  12-chip/34ms funnel stagger the old CSS system used — `stylesheets.test.ts`
  no longer asserts a celebration budget on it (nothing to key off, now that
  chips are meshes) but `lib/scene/chip-physics.test.ts` proves the same
  budget analytically. `window.__stackchipsScene` is a deliberate,
  production-shipped debug/test seam (`chips()`, `pileSize()`, `seat(slot)`,
  `roomScale()`, `roomLift()`, `awake()`, `lastFunnel()`) exposing only
  already-visible projected coordinates. `next/dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`
  code-splits the ~350KB gzip of three.js out of the main bundle (measured
  221KB main / 131KB lazy chunk) so the lobby/store/landing pages never pay
  for it. `tests/e2e/table-scene.spec.ts` (HUD-hit-testing, fit sanity, the
  sprite layer's default-on alignment and the `?webglAvatars=0` kill-switch
  fallback) and a rewritten
  `tests/e2e/chip-flights.spec.ts` (payout targeting, verified two ways: a
  direct `funnelSlots`/DOM-`.seat-winner` mapping assertion, plus a
  rank-based "closed more ground than all but one seat" geometry check —
  ratio/absolute-distance/nearest-seat variants were all tried and rejected,
  see the file's own comments) both pass repeatedly (5x-repeat, 10/10). Full
  `npm test`/`npm run lint`/`npm run build` all clean, with the one
  pre-existing `bot-personality.test.ts` Monte Carlo VPIP timeout (confirmed
  reproducible on a clean `main` checkout, unrelated to this work) as the
  only exception. A separately-reproduced, pre-existing e2e flake —
  `dealing.spec.ts`'s mobile-viewport quick-play test getting stuck "sat out"
  across many hands — was confirmed via `git stash` to already fail on clean
  `main` before any of this session's changes; it is a real bug but not one
  this work touched or introduced, and remains open.
- Chip sprays are value-based now, not decorative: `spawnBet`/`spawnFunnel`
  fly the *amount* as chips — the same greedy `potChipStacks` breakdown the
  pot pile uses, flattened per-chip by `sprayDenominations`/
  `betSprayDenominations`/`funnelSprayDenominations` in
  `lib/scene/chip-physics.ts` (smallest-first flight order so big chips land
  on top; truncation drops from the small end, keeping the hundreds). The
  bet spray carries the seat's committed *delta* (a raise to 200 over 50
  already in flies the 150) — `poker-table.tsx`'s flight detector already
  computed that delta and used to discard it. The funnel flies each
  `Winner.amount` individually, so a split pot pays each share as the money
  it is. Caps: `BET_SPRAY_MAX_CHIPS` (10, legibility only) and
  `FUNNEL_CHIP_COUNT` (12 — now a hard *ceiling*, not a fixed count; the
  `NEXT_HAND_DELAY_MS` celebration-budget proof in `chip-physics.test.ts`
  solves its worst case from it, and a test pins the cap for absurd
  amounts). `BET_CHIP_COUNT`(3)/`decorativeDenomination` survive only as the
  fallback spray for malformed inputs (the empty-breakdown case), so a bad
  snapshot degrades to the old behavior rather than a silent bet. Verified:
  scene unit tests, lint, `tsc`, build all clean; both scene e2e specs (8
  tests) pass live post-change.
- Manifest (`app/manifest.ts`) now locks `orientation: "portrait-primary"`
  and ships real icons: `public/icons/icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png` /
  `icon-512-maskable.png`, rasterized from the existing `app/icon.svg` mark
  via ImageMagick (the maskable variant pads the same art to an ~80% safe
  zone on a solid background rather than reusing the flat SVG, which Android
  would otherwise center-crop). `public/sw.js` bumped to
  `stackchips-shell-v5` to precache them. New `components/install-prompt.tsx`
  captures `beforeinstallprompt` for Android/desktop Chrome and shows an
  instructional "Share → Add to Home Screen" variant on iOS Safari (which
  never fires that event); it reuses the existing `.save-progress-notice`
  shell from `components/lobby/lobby.tsx` verbatim rather than inventing a
  new banner style, and its own dismissal persists to `localStorage` with a
  14-day cooldown, not permanently. Mounted in the lobby hub, gated on
  `entryComplete && profile && !game`.
- Mobile safe-area audit found the app shell/action-bar/header already
  handled `env(safe-area-inset-*)` correctly everywhere except one shared
  shell: `.history-drawer` (`app/styles/10-notices.css`, reused verbatim by
  `.friends-drawer`) had zero inset handling on any side, in either its
  desktop right-slide-in form or its mobile bottom-sheet override
  (`app/styles/12-responsive.css`). Fixed following the codebase's own
  `max(Npx, env(...))` idiom — right/top insets on the side-drawer form,
  left inset + a 16px-floored bottom inset on the bottom-sheet form (whose
  `padding-top` is explicitly zeroed since that form no longer touches the
  top edge). Verified against actual computed styles via a headless
  Playwright check, not just by reading the CSS.
- Menu music is now plug-and-play but still silent: `lib/audio/music-
  manifest.ts` + `lib/audio/menu-music.ts` mirror the existing SFX
  architecture (`lib/audio/manifest.ts` + `sound-effects.ts`) exactly —
  cached looping `<audio>`, fade in/out, autoplay-blocked retry on the next
  gesture — but `MENU_MUSIC_TRACK` is `null` by design, the same "no
  verified asset yet" convention `lose`/`timeout`/`time-card` already use in
  the SFX manifest. No royalty-free track was sourced or embedded — that
  needs a real licensed file, which isn't something to fabricate or fetch
  blind. Dropping one at the documented path and flipping that one constant
  is the entire remaining step. Wired into `poker-app.tsx` exactly like the
  existing `soundEnabled`/`toggleSound`/`SOUND_STORAGE_KEY` block (new
  `musicEnabled`/`toggleMenuMusic`/`MUSIC_STORAGE_KEY`, a "Menu music: On/Off"
  entry in `lobbyMenuItems`), started/stopped on the one screen boundary
  that actually exists in this app: `!game` (lobby/hub) vs. `game` truthy
  (seated at a table, hand or no hand in progress).
- UI polish pass: the repeated flat 2-stop `linear-gradient(180deg, …)`
  button fills across `app/styles/09-action-bar.css` (fold/check/call/raise/
  primary, all six action buttons) and the gold CTAs in
  `app/styles/04-lobby.css` (`.primary-action`, `.account-primary-action`,
  `.landing-cta-primary`) were the clearest "generic template" tell — same
  flat fade repeated on every button with no differentiation. Replaced with
  a shared 3-stop, steeper-angle treatment (a lighter highlight stop near
  the top) plus a thin inset top highlight on `.action-slot-controls
  button`'s base box-shadow, so buttons read as an enameled/beveled surface
  rather than a CSS-101 gradient swatch. Deliberately did not touch
  `05-game-header.css`'s felt-lighting radial-gradients (already
  hand-tuned, per that file's own comment about avoiding banding on real
  devices) or the green/gold palette itself, per prior guidance on this
  project.
- The Adsterra CSP block (`app/layout.tsx`'s hardcoded ad script against
  `next.config.ts`'s CSP, previously flagged and left unfixed) is now fixed:
  `next.config.ts` adds `https://*.effectivecpmnetwork.com` to `script-src`
  (the loader) and a new `frame-src` directive (the ad unit itself renders in
  an iframe per its `format: 'iframe'` config, and CSP's `frame-src` falls
  back to `default-src 'self'` when absent, which was blocking the iframe
  independently of the script). Wildcarded on the subdomain rather than
  pinned to `pl30614360...` because Adsterra serves creative from other
  subdomains of the same registrable domain, not a fixed host. Worth noting
  for whoever picks this back up: Adsterra is a known-aggressive ad network
  (popunders/redirect creative are common complaints against it), and CSP
  only constrains where a resource can load *from* — it doesn't vet what
  that resource does once loaded. If the ad unit still doesn't render fully
  live, or renders something that looks like a redirect/popunder rather than
  a banner, the next domains to check are `img-src`/`connect-src`, not
  `script-src`/`frame-src` again.
- `GoldBadge` (`components/profile/gold-badge.tsx`, the navbar balance) no
  longer prefixes the number with a `"Gold: "` label — just the coin icon and
  the amount (or `Unlimited`). `.gold-balance` is a flex row with `gap: 4px`
  between children, so dropping the label span needed no CSS change. The
  `.gold-badge` pill's own border is gone too (`app/styles/02-app-shell.css`)
  — background/padding/radius stay, just no outline around it.
- A departed bot's seat no longer vanishes or resets on the spot — it was
  already almost true at the data layer (`reseat()` in engine.ts is the
  *only* place a departed bot's identity gets overwritten; a voluntary leave
  only ever touches `status`/`stack`/`reseatEligibleAt`, per that field's own
  comment on `Seat` in `lib/game/types.ts`), so this was a client-rendering
  gap, not an engine change. `lib/game/seat-presence.ts` exports
  `isBotAway(seat)` — `status === "out" && reseatEligibleAt !== null`, the
  one signal that tells a bot's voluntary departure apart from every other
  `"out"` seat (a busted human's rebuy grace, a seat claimed mid-hand).
  `components/table/player-seat.tsx` uses it for a `.seat-away` class (fuller
  grayscale + dimmer than an ordinary `.seat-muted` fold, in
  `app/styles/08-seat.css`) and swaps the stack row's chip count — which
  would otherwise misleadingly read "0" — for a fixed "Sitting out" label.
  That label is intentionally not the old removed status-pill pattern:
  `table-feed.spec.ts` asserts no seat prints a `.status-pill`/`.action-pill`
  (variable-length prose that clipped under the table), and this is a
  different class, a constant string, sitting in the stack row's existing box
  rather than a new floating element, so it can't reproduce that bug. Pure
  logic lives in `lib/game` rather than on the component specifically so it's
  reachable by `npm test` — `vitest.config.ts`'s `include` only covers `lib/`
  and `app/`, so nothing under `components/` runs today, which is also why
  there's no React/RTL test here, only the six-case unit test on `isBotAway`
  itself. Verified live, not just by reading the CSS: a memory-mode dev
  server with `RIVER_BOT_LEAVE_CHANCE=1` forced multiple bots away in one
  hand, and a Playwright check confirmed the grayscale/opacity/label on the
  rendered seats and screenshotted the result.
- Active slice (parked): M16 — friends and table invites. The friends half is landed
  end to end: `lib/server/friends-store.ts`, `/api/friends/*`, and the drawer
  plus lobby tile in `components/social/friends-drawer.tsx`. The table invite
  half now has its read path: `lib/server/table-invite-store.ts` and
  `GET /api/invites/pending`. Still missing: the POST route that sends one
  (and with it the "inviter must be seated here" check), accept/decline, and
  any UI.
- Invite freshness is a predicate on each row's `expires_at`, never a
  consequence of the sweep. `getPendingTableInvites` filters
  `expires_at > now()`, so a lapsed invite disappears the second it lapses
  even if nothing has marked it `expired`. `expireStaleTableInvites` is
  housekeeping — throttled to once a minute per process off the polled read,
  and called unconditionally by `createTableInvite`, which is the one caller
  whose correctness needs it: `table_invites_one_pending_per_target` is
  partial on `status = 'pending'`, so a timed-out row still marked pending
  would hold the slot and turn a legitimate re-invite into `already_pending`.
- `app/styles/21-friends.css`'s `.friends-list`/`.friend-row` padding now
  matches `.activity-list`/`.activity-item` in `11-panels.css` (12px, not
  8px/10px) — both share the exact `.history-drawer` shell, and the two
  panels ticking at different paddings was the only real inconsistency a
  rendered check turned up. `.friends-list` also hides its scrollbar
  cross-browser (`scrollbar-width: none` + `::-webkit-scrollbar`) while
  staying scrollable; verified against a live dev-mode render with a mocked
  `/api/friends` payload, not just by reading the CSS.
- Invites are private-table-only, and that is schema, not policy:
  `table_invites.room_code` is not null and a public table's `roomCode` is
  null. The code stays server-side — `PendingTableInvite` omits it and the
  read never selects it, so accepting can join without either party being
  handed something they could forward. A test asserts the absence.
- State: M12–M15 landed. M15's server half (hand archives, `archive_hand` RPC,
  `/api/history` routes) is unchanged and still has no UI reading it.
- Friends are registered-accounts-only, matching `/api/history`: 401 with no
  session, 403 for a guest. `requireRegisteredProfile` in
  `lib/server/api-auth.ts` is the single place that split lives.
- `friends-store.ts` projects to its own `FriendSummary`/`PendingRequest`
  rather than returning `PlayerProfile`. Deliberate: `publicProfile()` carries
  `goldBalance`/`unlimitedGold`/`lastDailyClaimAt`, which are fine to show an
  owner about themselves and wrong to show about anyone else. A test asserts
  the absence.
- Accepting a request goes through the `accept_friend_request` RPC
  (`20260804140000_accept_friend_request.sql`), not two PostgREST calls. Split,
  a failure between settle and insert leaves "accepted but not friends", which
  no retry can detect because the request is no longer pending.
- Duplicate/crossed friend requests are detected by the two partial unique
  indexes and surfaced from a `23505`, not by a check-then-insert. Checking
  first cannot see the crossed case (A asks B while B asks A) without a lock.
- `Seat.profileId` carries a *registered* human's profile id into the public
  snapshot, so one player can name another without the client ever holding
  `ownerToken`. Persisted at seat time, not resolved on read: `toSnapshot` is
  pure and synchronous, and `ensureProfile` both writes and would run per seat
  per fetch. Guests stay null — a request addressed to a cookie-lived profile
  can never be accepted. `normalizeGameState` pins non-humans to null, so a
  stale id cannot survive one round trip.
- Every path that makes a seat human must set `profileId`. `claimSeat` sets it;
  `applyHumanIdentity` in the table-manager adapter *clears* it (that worker
  has only a session token) — it mutates a seat that may still hold the last
  occupant's id, and normalize cannot catch it because the seat is human.
  Worker-run tables therefore cannot add friends, which is the honest answer.
- The friends drawer (`components/social/friends-drawer.tsx`) opens from a
  lobby hub tile and owns its own fetch; no state is lifted into
  `poker-app.tsx`. It reuses `.history-overlay`/`.history-drawer` and
  `ProfileAvatar` rather than restating them — `app/styles/21-friends.css`
  holds only list-specific rules.
- Wire types live in `lib/social/types.ts`, not the store: `friends-store.ts`
  is `server-only`, so a client import would drag the service-role client into
  the browser bundle. Same reasoning as `lib/game/table-channel.ts`.
- **No seat-based discovery yet.** The snapshot carries the id, but nothing
  sends a request with it — the seat menu that would is the next slice. The
  drawer renders whatever `/api/friends` returns, so existing friendships and
  pending requests do display; what is missing is any in-app way to *start* a
  request, which is why a new account sees an empty list.
- All four M15/M16 migrations (`hand_archives`, `friends_and_table_invites`,
  `accept_friend_request`, `revoke_archive_hand_from_public`) are now applied
  to the live production Supabase project, pushed one at a time with a
  dry-run and a health check between each. `service_role`'s EXECUTE on
  `archive_hand`/RPCs comes from an independent per-role grant (verified via
  `aclexplode` against production), not from the PUBLIC grant the last
  migration revokes — confirmed before pushing, not assumed. No local
  Postgres/`psql` is available here, so this is still what verified it, not a
  local run; the memory-mode branch is what the 22+ store tests cover.
- The friends routes were live in production (returning 401, not 404) before
  their backing tables existed, so any real registered user opening the
  friends drawer before this push was almost certainly hitting a 500 from
  `friends-store.ts`'s missing-relation error. That is now fixed.
- Bot lifecycle: busted seats are released and reseated at the head of
  `setupHand` via `releaseBustedSeats` — busted *bots* used to stay busted, so
  a table walked 6 → 5 → 4 and stopped. Refill stops at `TABLE_FUNDED_FLOOR`
  (4), not at six: topping every seat up pins the table full forever, which
  deletes short-handed play and makes unbacked bot chips a renewable source of
  Gold on cash-out. Override with `RIVER_TABLE_FUNDED_FLOOR` (tests only).
- Bot identity rotates on every release path and is persisted as
  `Seat.botIdentity`, an index into an 18-strong pool. It must stay persisted:
  `normalizeGameState` used to re-derive a bot's face from `position` on every
  load, which silently reverted any rotation on the next snapshot. Identities
  are seeded from `id:handNumber:position`, never `Math.random()`, because two
  writers race the same seat and must compute the same answer.
- The "AI" seat badge is gone from the felt. The disclosure now lives in the
  Terms of Service, which is at version 2 — that bump re-prompts every existing
  player, deliberately.
- Turn clocks no longer tick through React. `components/table/use-fuse.ts`
  writes `--fuse-duration`/`--fuse-delay` once per turn and CSS animates both
  the seat ring and the action bar; `poker-table.tsx`'s 250ms `clockNow` state,
  which re-rendered the whole table tree 4Hz, is gone.
- Eight-max: geometry only. `SEAT_COUNT` is still 6 and the DB still constrains
  `cash_game_sessions.seat_number` to 1–6. `seatGeometry` is parametric and
  already yields the eight clock positions; `seatWidthFor` now takes a count.
  The feared 10:30-seat/`.table-feed` collision was measured and does not
  exist (D2 in `docs/known-defects.md` is withdrawn); a guard in
  `tests/e2e/table-feed.spec.ts` holds the clearance. The real blockers are
  `SEAT_COUNT`, the `MAX_SEATS` assertion, and the DB seat_number constraint.
- Busted-seat UI (`components/table/action-bar.tsx`) no longer offers a
  "Close seat" button. There never was a separate "Close Seat" concept
  anywhere else in the codebase — this was the only one, and it just forced
  an immediate `next-hand` action rather than waiting out
  `BUSTED_REBUY_GRACE_MS`. The header's persistent "Leave table" button
  already calls `leave-seat` for a seated player (`leaveTable` in
  `poker-app.tsx`), which is the actual, already-working exit; the busted
  branch now renders only the (already gold-styled, via
  `.action-slot-controls .primary-action`) Rebuy/Buy-Gold-to-rebuy button.
  No engine change was needed or made: `setupHand` already marks a busted
  seat `"out"` (skipped from turn order) between hands, and
  `releaseBustedSeats` + `scheduleNextHand`'s `BUSTED_REBUY_GRACE_MS` +
  `dealNextHandIfDue` already auto-advance and auto-reseat a busted human to
  a bot if they let the grace window lapse, all without a UI action —
  `busted-seat.test.ts`/`continuous-table.test.ts` already cover this and
  keep passing. A per-seat "Sat Out" status pill was deliberately not added:
  `83c585d` removed the last per-seat status pill for a real clipping bug the
  day before this note was written, with dedicated e2e coverage
  (`tests/e2e/table-feed.spec.ts`) asserting no seat renders one; `"out"` in
  `SeatStatus` already *is* sat-out and is already wired through
  `inHand`/`canAct`/the seat-dimming `folded` check.
- `createGame` (`lib/game/engine.ts`) now gives each bot seat a randomized
  starting stack via `randomBotStack` — uniform in `[buyIn, buyIn * 3]`,
  snapped to the nearest big blind. The human seat is never randomized. This
  does not touch `TIER_CONFIG` (`minBuyIn === maxBuyIn` per tier is still
  exactly true; a human still buys in for precisely the tier's number) — only
  what a freshly-created bot seat happens to be carrying. `claimSeat` already
  discards whatever a bot seat was holding and resets to the claiming
  player's own paid buy-in, so this cannot leak un-backed bot chips to a
  human. Fixed three tests that had baked in the old uniform-1000-per-seat
  assumption (two hardcoded `6000` chip-conservation totals in
  `engine.test.ts`, now computed dynamically; `betting-round.test.ts`'s
  `allHumanTable()` fixture, which now explicitly pins every seat back to a
  clean `1000 - committed` since it needs a deterministic table and
  `createGame` already posts hand 1's blinds before returning).
- **Vercel's production branch is `main`, not `ui-redesign-foundation`.**
  Pushing to `ui-redesign-foundation` only ever produces a Preview
  deployment — confirmed via the GitHub Deployments API (`environment` field)
  after a push sat live-but-not-live for several minutes. `main` reached its
  current state via a single PR merge (#1) from `ui-redesign-foundation` at
  `b753717`; there was no other divergence. Getting new work on
  `ui-redesign-foundation` in front of players means a PR into `main` (`gh pr
  create --base main --head ui-redesign-foundation`) and merging it, the same
  way #1 did — not a direct push. Verify a deploy actually landed against the
  *Production* environment (`gh api repos/Nikkayowill/poker/deployments`),
  not just that the merge succeeded, and confirm against the live site
  itself (e.g. a route that only exists in the new code, like
  `/api/invites/pending`, flipping from `404` to a real status).
- The four M15/M16 migrations, the friends-drawer scrollbar/spacing polish,
  the busted-seat "Close seat" removal, and randomized bot starting stacks
  are all live on `www.stackchips.app` as of PR #2 (merge commit
  `3285d5c`) — verified against the Production deployment's own status, not
  assumed from the merge alone.
- `claimSeat` (`lib/game/engine.ts`) no longer lets a mid-hand seat claim buy
  into the hand already running. Previously it converted the bot to a human
  but left `holeCards`/`status`/`acted` untouched, so a player who sat down
  on a bot mid-hand inherited its actual cards and turn — including, if the
  bot was the last seat needing to act, an uncontested win off cards they
  never saw dealt. The new occupant is now forced `status = "out"` for the
  rest of that hand (cleared `holeCards`, never in `nextSeat`'s `canAct`
  rotation), with `remaining(state).length === 1` / `wasCurrentTurn` handled
  the same way an ordinary fold is, and returns to `"active"` automatically
  at the next `setupHand`. `action-bar.tsx` shows a "Sat out" status card
  (reusing `.action-slot-status`/`.action-kicker`, not a new per-seat pill —
  see the note below on why one was deliberately removed) whenever
  `game.status === "playing"` and the caller's own seat is `"out"`, which
  given the fix can now only mean "claimed mid-hand, waiting for next deal."
- The reported "multi-human freeze" (a busted human stalling the table with
  other humans seated) and "expired rebuy squatting" did not reproduce.
  `canAct`/`nextSeat` already skip a busted seat within a hand regardless of
  how many humans are at the table (`commit` marks it `"all-in"`, not
  `"active"`, the instant its stack hits zero), and `turn-clock.ts` already
  queues every seated human as a backup clock-advancer rather than electing
  one — a repro test driving a 6-human table through an all-in bust and past
  its `BUSTED_REBUY_GRACE_MS` deadline completed the hand and dealt the next
  one without a stall, and `busted-seat.test.ts`'s existing "does not lose a
  seat per bust" test already covers four *sequential* human busts staying
  funded. If this is still observed live, it likely needs exact repro steps
  (timing, seat count, Supabase vs. memory mode) rather than another look at
  this code path in isolation.
- Bot personality (`lib/game/engine.ts`) is now rolled independently per seat
  via `pickBotPersonality()` (`randomInt`-weighted MANIAC/ROCK/CALLING_STATION
  35/45/20 — "Loose Cannon"/"Table Captain"/"Whale"), not baked onto a fixed
  pool-identity pattern the way it used to be. `botProfiles[]` is identity
  (name/face) only now; personality is a separate axis, called fresh from
  `createGame` and every `restoreBotControl` reseat, so a bot sitting back
  down needn't play like the one that left. The type names weren't renamed —
  `personalityProfiles` and the preflop chart are still keyed on
  `MANIAC`/`ROCK`/`CALLING_STATION` — only the flavor mapping and the
  assignment mechanism changed.
- The actual "boring preflop folding" fix is `trashContinueChance`, a new
  per-personality field on `personalityProfiles`: previously *every*
  personality hard-folded a "trash"-tier hand preflop outside a fixed 5%
  bluff roll, so no archetype ever played a visibly different range. Now that
  gate is `!bluffWindow && !trashContinueRoll`, where `trashContinueRoll`
  reads the *same* `decisionRoll` the bluff gate already consumes (no extra
  `random()` call, so it doesn't shift any downstream draw a seeded test
  depends on) against a personality-specific threshold. Calibrated against a
  new Monte Carlo VPIP test (`lib/game/bot-personality.test.ts`, seeded
  hole cards + seeded decision rolls, fully deterministic) to land ROCK
  ~26%, MANIAC ~45%, CALLING_STATION ~64% — inside the requested 25–35% /
  40–50% / 60%+ bands. `MANIAC` also gets a `shoveEquityDiscount` (reaches
  for all-in with merely-good equity/a strong draw, not just the nuts) and
  `ROCK` a `limperPunishBonus` (raises limps more readily); both are small,
  additive nudges to the existing shove/raise-decision thresholds, not new
  decision paths.
- Table traffic: `TABLE_FUNDED_FLOOR` is 6 now, not 4 — the old floor of 4
  was a blunt cap on bot stacks becoming a renewable Gold-farming source, but
  to a real player two permanently-empty seats reads as a shrinking
  tournament, not a cash table. The actual guardrail moved from *whether* a
  seat refills to *when*: a bot that busts from losing its stack still
  refills the same hand it always has (unaffected), but a **healthy** bot can
  now voluntarily stand up between hands (`BOT_VOLUNTARY_LEAVE_CHANCE` in
  `releaseBustedSeats`, never below 3 funded seats) and its seat then sits
  out — reusing the existing `"out"`/`.seat-muted` dimmed rendering, no new
  UI — until a randomized `Seat.reseatEligibleAt` timestamp
  (`BOT_REENTRY_DELAY_MIN_MS`/`MAX_MS`, ~30s–3min) elapses. `botVoluntaryLeaveChance()`
  is `0` whenever `process.env.VITEST` is set (same guard `logTurn` in
  `game-store.ts` already uses) regardless of its env override, because it
  rolls inside `releaseBustedSeats`, which hundreds of existing tests reach
  indirectly through `setupHand`/`dealNextHandIfDue` — without the guard, an
  unpredictable subset of the whole suite would go flaky the moment any test
  happened to run enough hands to hit the roll. Tests that exercise it set
  `RIVER_BOT_LEAVE_CHANCE` to exactly `0` or `1` (read manually, not via the
  file's usual `Number(...) || default` idiom, since `Number("0") || 0.05`
  would silently discard an explicit "disable this"). Raising the floor
  alone broke one existing test's chip-conservation invariant
  (`engine.test.ts`'s "plays repeated complete hands" — a single bot bust now
  refills immediately instead of only past 2+ busts, minting chips more
  often) — fixed by tracking minted amounts explicitly rather than assuming
  a fixed table total.
- Gold: `creditGold`'s Supabase path (`lib/server/profile-store.ts`) used to
  be a plain read-then-write, unlike `spendGold`'s guarded `spend_gold` RPC —
  a real (pre-existing, not bot-specific) lost-update race under concurrent
  credits, e.g. a rebuy refund racing a cash-out credit. Closed with a new
  `credit_gold` RPC (`supabase/migrations/20260804160000_credit_gold_rpc.sql`)
  mirroring `spend_gold`/`claim_daily_gold`'s exact `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
  pattern; `creditGold` now calls it instead of reading then writing. No
  behavior change to the in-memory branch (already single-threaded) or to
  any caller's contract. Not yet applied to the live Supabase project — no
  local Postgres is available here, same constraint as the M15/M16
  migrations; needs the same one-at-a-time dry-run-then-push treatment
  before it's live.
