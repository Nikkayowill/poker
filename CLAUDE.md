# StackChips — Claude Context

## Project

StackChips (`stackchips.app`) is a Next.js 16/React 19/strict TypeScript six-max Hold'em app. The server is authoritative. Supabase supplies persistence, Realtime, Auth linkage, and Storage; absent env vars, stores use memory.

## System map

`components -> app/api -> lib/game -> lib/server -> memory | Supabase`

- `app/`: App Router pages/API; `app/page.tsx` mounts `components/poker-app.tsx`.
- `components/`: client state plus lobby, table, profile, store, admin UI.
- `lib/game/`: pure engine/types/evaluator/timing/snapshot redaction.
- `lib/server/`: game/profile/economy/session/admin persistence.
- `lib/supabase/`: shared browser client and SSR helpers.
- `supabase/migrations/`: imperative schema, RLS, RPCs, Realtime.
- `app/styles/`: numbered cascade; `app/globals.css` fixes load order.
- Tests: colocated Vitest units; `tests/e2e/` Playwright.

Realtime carries only versioned invalidations; `components/poker-app.tsx` refetches the filtered snapshot. Browser requests contain intents only.

## Read first

- App/client: `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `components/poker-app.tsx`
- Lobby/table: `components/lobby/lobby.tsx`, `components/table/poker-table.tsx`
- Game routes: `app/api/games/`, especially `[id]/actions/route.ts` and `[id]/advance/route.ts`
- Rules: `lib/game/engine.ts`, `lib/game/types.ts`, `lib/game/evaluator.ts`
- Data: `lib/server/game-store.ts`, `lib/server/profile-store.ts`, `lib/server/supabase-admin.ts`
- Auth: `middleware.ts`, `lib/server/session.ts`, `lib/auth/client.ts`
- Realtime: `lib/game/table-channel.ts`
- DB/env: `supabase/migrations/`, `supabase/config.toml`, `.env.example`
- Product constraints: `docs/game-loop.md`, `docs/launch-checklist.md`, `docs/security-audit.md`

## Rules

- Mutate through server routes + engine; never accept client-owned game truth.
- Keep game reads write-free and mutations version-checked/atomic.
- Never leak service-role secrets or private aggregate state; preserve RLS.
- Append migrations; preserve numbered CSS order.
- `river_*` cookies/module names and Sentry slugs are legacy compatibility IDs; do not casually rename them.
- Test changed rules/layout. Run: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`; use `npm run test:e2e` for flows/UI.
- Preserve unrelated work; `.claude/` may be locally untracked.

## Active milestone

- Track: `ui-redesign-foundation`
- Active slice: M15 — personal hand history and replay.
- State: M12, M13, M14a and M14b are landed and verified. M15's server half is
  in the working tree: the `hand_archives`/`hand_archive_players` migration,
  `archive_hand` RPC, `lib/server/hand-archive-store.ts`, and the two
  `/api/history` routes. No history UI yet — nothing in `components/` reads
  these routes.
- Two supporting changes landed with it: `lib/server/hand-completion.ts` is now
  the single post-hand hook (it replaced two drifted `recordHandStats` call
  sites, one of which never checked avatar unlocks), and
  `lib/supabase/public-env.ts` accepts Supabase's publishable-key env name
  alongside the legacy anon-key name.
- Keep this section synchronized with `AGENTS.md` when scope changes.
